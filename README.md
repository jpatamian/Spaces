#SPACES

Spaces provides an easy way to filter through travel accommodations and tourism spots, for specifically LGBT friendly spaces, so they can feel safe throughout their travels. It also provides reviews from members of the community. The back-end was built on Rails, while the front-end was built with React to enhance the user experience. I incorporated the Yelp & Meetup APIs to provide the user abilities to search external websites for more information.
